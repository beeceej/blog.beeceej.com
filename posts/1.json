    "**Open source** enables people who enjoy tinkering to take ownership over what they're using on his or her machine. This rings true whether or not you're a hacker or not. As a developer I am able to easily fork a codebase, look at the internals of it, fix a problem I (or millions others) have and contribute back. If that isn't true power, I don't know what is.\n\nThe cross polination of ideas and methods is what makes open source software such a beautiful thing. As the world continues to build upon software every person should be able to feel empowered to influence the direction of technology, and the world. I am a developer so it is only natural that I enjoy digging into the internals of complex systems, but I know this isn't the case for everyone. Let's work to empower everyone to feel as if they have the ability to influence the technology around them\n\n -beeceej",
